Enables you to create email links that load differently depending on who visits the page, where they visit the page from, where on the site they see the link, and more.

== Description ==

The dyn-mailto Wordpress plugin enables you to create mailto links that load differently depending on who visits the page, where they visit the page from, where on the site they see the link, and more. You create a mailto link by writing a template that, when it comes time to render to someone visiting your website, has the appropriate fields substituted where ever you've designated.

This plugin allows you to write dynamic mailto links that can access information about:
    * The user's IP address and geographic location, including country, region and city
    * The Wordpress user account (if logged in)
    * The Wordpress site itself
    * The Wordpress post that the link is viewed on

In addition to including relevant data in the link, dynamic mailto links can incorporate useful logical constructs, including if statements, loops and randomizing fields.
